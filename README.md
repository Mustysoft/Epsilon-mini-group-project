Description of Epsilon group project: The project is created 
On school login page that saves the information about student in the database, 
And we tried to outline some importance of database.

How the project was created:
We had several meeting between the group members deciding
On what to create finally after concluding we had to know which part each member are good 
At some where good at css,html, php etc.
So we had to design an algorithm of the structure of the project
